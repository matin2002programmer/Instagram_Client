# InstagramClient

An advanced **Instagram Media Downloader & Uploader** built in Python.  
This class lets you **download posts, reels, stories, highlights, or full profiles**, as well as **upload posts/reels** and **comment on posts** — all programmatically.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔽 **Download**  
  - Posts (single image, video, or carousel)  
  - Reels  
  - Stories (single story via URL or all active stories)  
  - Highlights  
  - Full profile (profile pic, posts, stories, highlights)

- 🔼 **Upload**  
  - Photos with captions  
  - Reels (with optional thumbnail and captions)

- 💬 **Interact**  
  - Comment on any post by URL  
  - Comment on the latest post of a user  

- 🔒 **Authentication**  
  - Cookie persistence (auto-load & save login cookies)  
  - Automatic re-login handling

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **HTTP Session & Tokens**  
   - Uses [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/) for requests.  
   - Fetches and manages **CSRF tokens**, **LSD tokens**, and session cookies for API calls.  
   - Randomizes user agents to avoid detection.  

2. **GraphQL & REST Endpoints**  
   - Uses Instagram’s private GraphQL `doc_id`s for posts, user feeds, and highlights.  
   - Uses REST API endpoints for stories and uploads.  

3. **Media Handling**  
   - Smart filename generation (sanitized from caption/shortcode).  
   - Downloads with progress tracking.  
   - Handles both images (`.jpg`) and videos (`.mp4`).  

4. **Upload Flow**  
   - Splits into two steps:  
     - **Upload** (chunked upload of photo/video).  
     - **Configure** (finalize post or reel with caption).

```

## ⚠️ Notes

- Uploading/commenting uses private web APIs → these may change, so stability is not 100% guaranteed.  
- Use responsibly; Instagram may **block accounts** that abuse these APIs.  
- For private profiles, you need to be logged in with permission to view.
